Problems in Infection Script:

- Fix map skip, change map: Server shutdown after current map is finished
- Please add "First Infected" text to scoreboard. It says only "Infected".
- Add survivor weapons
- At the moment: First infected can shoot until he infects someone and then respawn. Fix it: First infected only can shoot if he is the only infected one. Update while playing.
